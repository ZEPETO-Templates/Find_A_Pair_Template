## :point_right: You can easily modify this:

<h3>FindAPair_Game Prefab:</h3>

**The idea behind this template is to provide you with a game ready to add to your world**

1. Open your Unity project and navigate to the location of the "FindAPair_Game" prefab.
2. Drag the "FindAPair_Game" prefab from the project window into your game scene hierarchy.
3. Place the "FindAPair_Game" prefab wherever you want it to appear in your game scene.
4. The mini-game will be fully functional, and you can test it within your game scene.


However, you can customize it in the following ways:

- <h3> IconInteraction</h3>
If you want to change the icon that appears over the NPC you have to change the PrefIconCanvas prefab:
1. Locate the PrefIconCanvas prefab in your Unity project.
2. Right-click on the PrefIconCanvas prefab and select "Edit Prefab" to open it in the Prefab Editor.
3. In the Prefab Editor, find the icon element that you want to change.
4. Select the icon element and replace it with your desired icon. You can do this by dragging and dropping a new sprite onto the icon element.
5. Once you have replaced the icon, click on "Apply" in the Prefab Editor to save your changes to the Prefab.
6. Close the Prefab Editor and return to your scene.
7. The icon that appears over the NPC should now be updated with your new icon.


- <h3>UI Prefabs</h3>
You can edit every panel of each part of the game from their own prefab.
You can found them in the project folder.

  To modify UI prefabs in Unity, follow these steps:
1. Locate the UI prefab you want to modify. You can find prefabs in the project folder under the "Prefabs" directory or in a specific folder for UI elements.
2. Double-click on the UI prefab to open it in the Prefab Editor.
3. In the Prefab Editor, you can modify the UI elements as needed. This may include changing text, images, layouts, or adding/removing components.
4. Once you have made your modifications, save the prefab by clicking the "Apply" button in the Prefab Editor.
5. To apply the changes to instances of the prefab in your scene, select each instance and click the "Apply" button in the Inspector window.
6. Test your changes in Play mode to ensure they work as expected.
7. If you need to make further modifications, repeat the above steps.
