## 🔨 Tools

**Game prefab**
To make things easier, there is a prefab called "RPS_Game" that you can drag into your game scene, and the mini-game will be already functional. You just need to place it wherever you want.

In the UIManager you have some options to tweak how the game looks like.
| Variable | Utility |
|--|--|
| Rock Sprite | Set the rock sprite in game |
